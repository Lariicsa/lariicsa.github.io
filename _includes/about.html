            Iâ€™m a Frontend developer with UI Design background and strong skills implementing HTML & CSS in
            different
            environments like Vue, .Net, and Angular. I have always enjoyed laying out and all related with user
            interactions.

            I think one of the skills that makes me different, in addition to my wide CSS knowledge, is to know all
            about user interfaces, design patterns and development interactions.
