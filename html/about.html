    <p>
      Iâ€™m a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> with UI Design background and strong skills implementing <strong>HTML &
        CSS</strong> in different
      environments like Vue, React, Angular, etc. I have always enjoyed laying out and all related with user
      interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think one of the skills that makes me different, in addition to my wide CSS knowledge, is to know all about user
      interfaces, design patterns and development interactions.
